I'm Lukian (or Luke) Wernyj, a rising senior at Rutgers University majoring in statistics and mathematics and minoring in quantitative economics. I was born in Baltimore, Maryland and grew up in Highland Park, New Jersey. I'm interested in probability theory, Monte Carlo, Bayesian inference, statistical learning, optimization, game theory, and adjacent topics.

Outside of academics, you can find me rowing on the Rutgers Crew, traveling, cycling, playing chess, fiddling on my guitar and making music, and watching Manchester United (which has been VERY difficult recently). Iâ€™ve produced Billboard-charting songs, and now enjoy working on data projects or learning about cool maths in my free time.
